## project Keypad Watch
Keypad Watch is a hobby project that I started and finished 
during my last gap year (Apr. 2018). It's a little wearable 
device I planned, designed and built from scratch. 
Intentionally, this is a wrist watch but has no screen. 
Numerical information can be displayed by on-and-off of the 
LEDs on each key.
